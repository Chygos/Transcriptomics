# Functional enrichment analysis

Ater extraction and annotation of differentially expressed genes it is important for us to identify biological functions that might be impacted by the depletion of Passilla(ps). But first, we would like to know if the differentially expressed genes are enriched transcripts of genes which belong to more common or specific catogories. We performed 2 analysis to address this
-gene ontology analysis
-Kegg pathway analysis

## 1.Gene Ontology Analysis
